link to the website:
https://syronox.github.io/space-tourism-website/

A site for a fictional space tourism company. 
This is a challenge from 'Frontend Mentor' which provided the images and the specifics of how the site should look like.

HTML
Each page in this site includes a header and a main section. The header is the navigation menu of the site.
Each main section features several sildes that include images, information and a description.
I used utility classes to design and structure the site.

CSS
I made the site responsive using media queries and the grid system, also I defined some variables whos value range according to the screen
size, effectively improving the responsiveness of the site.

JavaScript
The role of the JS in this site is to toggle the navigation menu when on mobile screen size and change the slides on each page.
I made a compect changeSilde function that is applicable to all the pages.

building this site got me to scour the web constantly in order to solve many issues that arose during the build.
Completing this challenge tought me a lot of new stuff:
I learned about code architecture.
I learned a lot of new CSS and HTML features.
I learned how to make my site accessible to people with visual imparity by including screen-readers only text in necessary places.
I improved the way I make sites responsive.
I leanred ways to make my site more addaptive to changes.

I made the design system of this site with guidance that tought me a lot, after that all of the site was made by me using the design system.
